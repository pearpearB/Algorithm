# Q.
A square of squares

You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

Examples

-1  =>  false\
 0  =>  true\
 3  =>  false\
 4  =>  true\
25  =>  true\
26  =>  false

# A)
```js
var isSquare = function(n){
  if (((Math.sqrt(n) % 1 === 0) || n === 0) && n >= 0)
    return true
  return false
}
```
